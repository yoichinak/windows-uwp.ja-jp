# <a name="guide-for-changing-your-dev-environment-from-mac-to-windows"></a>Guide for changing your dev environment from Mac to Windows

The following tips and control equivalents should help you in your transition between a Mac and Windows (or WSL/Linux) development environment.

For app development, the nearest equivalent to Xcode would be [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com). There is also a version of [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/), if you ever feel the need to go back. For cross-platform source code editing (and a huge number of plug-ins) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?wt.mc_id=DX_841432) is the most popular choice.

## <a name="terminal-and-shell"></a>ターミナルとシェル

Windows provides several alternatives to the Mac's terminal emulator.

1. The Windows Command Line

The Windows command line will accept DOS commands, and is the most commonly used command line tool on Windows. To open it: Press **Windows+R** to open the **Run** box, then type **cmd** and then click **OK**. To open an administrator command line, type **cmd** and then press **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**. 

2. PowerShell

[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-6) is a "PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET. PowerShell helps system administrators and power-users rapidly automate tasks that manage operating systems". In other words, it's a very powerful command line, and is especially loved by system admins.

Incidentally, PowerShell is [also available for Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-6).

3. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

WSL allows you to run a Linux shell within Windows. This means you can run *bash** or other shell, depending on choice and the specific Linux distro installed. Using WSL will provide the kind of environment most familiar to Mac users. For example, you will **ls** to list the files in a current directory, not **dir** as you would with the Windows command line. To learn about instaling and using WSL, see the [Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
